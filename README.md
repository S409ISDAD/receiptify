# Receiptify
To use receiptify you must have a Mcdonalds receipt with a 12 character code on top and an email address handy to receive the result.

## How does this work?
McDonalds offers a special promo in the UK where if you enter a 12 character code on top of a receipt and fill in a survey, you can have a
big mac and fries or something similar for Â£1.99. This CLI utility can perform the entire survey in about 15 seconds and use an email you
provide to send the code to. This fills out all good reviews as to limit the questions and not be a terrible human being.
